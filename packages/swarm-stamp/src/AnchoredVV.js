// Version vectors are a correct, but expensive way of dealing with partial
// orders. Size of a version vector depends on the number of event sources
// (processes) in a distributed system. Typically, we don't need it, as
// concurrent events tend to be an exception, not a rule.
// Anchored version vectors save space by describing de-facto orders as
// deviations of some linear total order. Most of the time, nothing special
// happens and local orders are in agreement both with the total order and
// each other. Then, an anchored vector only consists of a single "anchor"
// timestamp. Everything behind that timestamp in the linear order is the
// "past" and everything ahead is the "future".
// When some concurrent events indeed happen, an anchored vector employs
// its vector part to describe the deviation (e.g. smaller-timestamp events
// arriving after some greater-timestamp event).
// Once orders return back to agreement, the vector component gets washed
// away, so only the anchor remains.
// Practically, Swarm employs anchored vectors to describe positions in
// de-facto arrival orders relative to another arrival order.
